        [Verse 1]
        Whale shark in the water floating by
        Stingrays swim beside him saying, "Hi"
        The otters and belugas, they all salute us
        Oh, what a beautiful day to stay inside
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Oh, the blue, blue water makes you look so pretty
        Next to jellyfishes swimming in captivity
        I know you're far more focused on the deep blue scenery
        But I can't focus when you're next to me
    
        [Chorus]
        Oh, Taroko
        Oh, I love you so
        Oh, Taroko
        Oh, I love you so
        
        [Verse 2]
        Admiring the fossils on the wall
        Not troubled about anything at all
        The manta rays above us, they stop to say they love us
        Oh, what a beautiful day to fall in love
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Oh, the blue, blue water makes you look so pretty
        Next to jellyfishes swimming in captivity
        I know you're far more focused on the deep blue scenery
        But I can't focus when you're next to me
        
        [Chorus]
        Oh, Taroko
        Oh, I love you so
        Oh, Taroko
        Oh, I love you so
        
        [Bridge]
        There's Taroko swimming by
        And there's Yushan, not far behind
        And your hand is falling into mine
        And with you I have nothing to hide
        
        [Verse 3]
        Oceanic wonders up above me
        A beauty that you're more than worthy of
        The ocean all around us, the happiness that found us
        Oh, what a beautiful day to fall in love
        
        [Outro]
        Oh, what a beautiful day to fall in love
        Oh, what a beautiful day to fall in love
